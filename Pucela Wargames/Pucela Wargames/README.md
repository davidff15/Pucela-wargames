# EventManagerApp

An event management app developed in SwiftUI following a clean, modular, and scalable architecture.

## 🚀 Technologies

- Swift 5
- SwiftUI
- MVVM + Clean Architecture
- Async/Await (Swift Concurrency)
- Modular layered architecture (UI, Business, Domain, Data, Network)

## 🛠️ Project Structure

## 📚 Key Concepts

- **Separation of concerns** across multiple layers (Domain, Data, Network, UI)
- **Domain Models** decoupled from network models (DTOs)
- **Mappers** to translate between Network Models and Domain Models
- **UseCases** representing business logic actions
- **Mocked networking layer** for local testing
- **Scalability and maintainability** as top priorities

## 🎯 Current Progress

- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Initial models and mappers implemented
- [x] Network service mocked
- [ ] HomeViewModel integration
- [ ] HomeView implementation
- [ ] Navigation to EventDetailView

## 🧠 Goal

To develop a clean, scalable, and production-ready event management app, suitable for inclusion in a professional portfolio.
